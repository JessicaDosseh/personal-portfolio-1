# Personal Portfolio Website

A personal portfolio is meant to be a personal touch in the otherwise routine process of a job search. It's a chance for a candidate to put emphasis on their journey, their personality, and to highlight pieces of work that are important to them.

In that respect, my portfolio follows what I'm passionate about in life; I like clean design, and minimalism has always appealed to me. It is because of these passions that I've developed a stylish-yet-minimal personal portfolio utilizing cutting-edge technology such as React Hooks (used in this portfolio during its alpha state and now in full release).
